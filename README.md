# CV-Maker

Fillup the form and get a resume ready instantly. 

**What this app does**: 

- Takes Dynamic User input via form.
- Adds renders a resume in the preview section.
- UI has all devices support.

**Drawbacks**: 
- Form history is non-persistant (You lose your data with page refresh - going to fix that in the next version).
- Can't print the resume yet.
